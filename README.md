In this guide we will describe required steps to announce hosts from first host group as /32 with specific community (blackhole for example) and hosts from second host group as /24 to DDoS scrubbing centrer via API (supported for F5 and Path.Net). Host group is a group of multiple networks in CIDR format.

This assumes that you have configured BGP connection. Please follow official [guide](https://fastnetmon.com/docs-fnm-advanced/fastnetmon-bgp-unicast-configuration/) for it.

After configuring BGP, please disable any standard actions for BGP. We will use notify script instead because we need custom logic:
```
sudo fcli set main gobgp_announce_host disable
sudo fcli set main gobgp_announce_whole_subnet disable
sudo fcli commit
```

First of all, convert (split or aggregate) all your networks in networks_list (sudo fcli show main networks_list) to /24 CIDR networks only.

You can remove existing networks from this list this way:
```
sudo fcli delete main networks_list 11.22.33.44/32
```

And add new ones this way:
```
sudo fcli set main networks_list 11.22.33.44/24
```

Then, you need to create two host groups.

First one for hosts where you need blackhole action.
```
sudo fcli set hostgroup host_to_blackhole
sudo fcli set hostgroup host_to_blackhole threshold_mbps 100
sudo fcli set hostgroup host_to_blackhole ban_for_bandwidth enable
sudo fcli set hostgroup host_to_blackhole enable_ban enable
sudo fcli set hostgroup host_to_blackhole networks 11.22.33.44/24
```

Second one for hosts where you need traffic diversion action:
```
sudo fcli set hostgroup host_to_scrubbing
sudo fcli set hostgroup host_to_scrubbing threshold_mbps 100
sudo fcli set hostgroup host_to_scrubbing ban_for_bandwidth enable
sudo fcli set hostgroup host_to_scrubbing enable_ban enable
sudo fcli set hostgroup host_to_scrubbing networks 10.10.10.10/24
```

Then you need to install DDoS scrubbing center integration with [F5 SilverLine](https://fastnetmon.com/docs-fnm-advanced/fastnetmon-advanced-integration-with-f5-silverline-ddos-scrubbing-centre/) or [Path.Net](https://fastnetmon.com/docs-fnm-advanced/fastnetmon-advanced-integration-with-path-net-ddos-scrubbing-centre/) but do not specify them in notify_script_path and do not make any fcli based configuration from any of these guides as we will call it manually from this script.

Please install JSON processing library for Perl:
```
sudo apt-get install -y libjson-perl libipc-run-perl git 
```

Finally, you need to download script from GitHub:
```
git clone git@github.com:FastNetMon/selective_bgp_blackhole_traffic_diversion_api.git
cd selective_blackhole_traffic_diversion
sudo cp notify_json.pl /usr/local/bin/notify_json.pl
```

And configure it for your FastNetMon instance to call it when FastNetMon detects an attack.
```
sudo fcli set main notify_script_enabled enable
sudo fcli set main notify_script_format json
sudo fcli set main notify_script_path /usr/local/bin/notify_json.pl
sudo fcli commit
```

After initial setup, we suggest manual check for hosts from each group and test FastNetMonâ€™s behaviour in each case.

To test host from group host_to_blackhole:
```
sudo fcli set blackhole 11.22.33.44
```

To test host from group host_to_scrubbing:
```
sudo fcli set blackhole 10.10.10.10
```

You can debug actions from our script using this command:
```
sudo tail -f /tmp/selective_bgp_blackhole_traffic_diversion_api.log
```
